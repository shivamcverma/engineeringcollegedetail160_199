They do not communicate well, have unnecessary attitudes, and sometimes, due to ego, they negatively affect students. Semester exams are average, not too hard, not too easy, and generally fair. Sometimes, however, they make very hard exams that are not related to previous year's questions or notes.",
              "Other": "I think the college should improve its faculty and focus on giving students free time. Too many classes make it hard for students to focus on their primary skills. Three-hour continuous classes on the same subject are not appreciated by students. In the name of training, they make students’ lives hard. Classes run from 8–4 with only one hour break for lunch. During exams, there is no break. Continuous exams are not appropriate. Students need some peace of mind and time to relax."

Top recruiting companies are TCS, Mahindra, and Tata Steel. 50 to 60 percent of students got internships by college or outside sources. Top role is circular designer.",

In hostels, the food they provide like roti is so hard and dal is fully water. One thing that is good here is snacks in the evening. The sports facility is good but not like NIT and IIT. There is one cafeteria in our college. Free medical facilities are provided by college.",

One thing I say, please come here only to pass the study because no other activities are happening here. We have to do everything ourselves. Here faculty members are mostly PhD scholars.",

It also organises seminars and research-related work for the students, and then they review the program to determine whether it has been successfully done or needs to be organised again. Hostels are awesome with all basic amenities, having nominal charges on a yearly basis, not more than Rs 5000.

I think 50% makes the students ready for the justice industry.",

If there are a meeting hall for students, they could discuss their problems with friends. Definitely, it would become the most loved department."

I am interested in Economics as a domain and want to pursue public policy. The student-to-teacher ratio is 1:5. The faculty is experienced and qualified as per UGC guidelines. The teaching methods were quite good, encouraged us to ask doubts, and showed interest in assisting during research work.",

Details about the courses can be seen on the college website. The end-term exams are usually problem-solving rather than essay-based (for most courses)."

The quality of food and taste is also okay but once or twice every 2 weeks, the mess food is not that much tasty and well prepared. They will provide high-protein foods like paneer and dal. For right now, there is no chicken curry for free so we have to pay the bill. Sports are available like cricket, football, badminton, volleyball, basketball, cricket, chess, carrom, etc.",

The institution is very keen on sports and games. They often host events, sports competitions, marathons, and football tournaments, which make us feel very energetic after hectic exams.",

There have been continuous complaints with the hostel, its food quality, and the quality of usage and drinking water of the hostel. There are no provisions for AC in the hostel as of November, 2025. During the summer, coolers are provided in rooms with extra charges per month. The hostel fee for 12 months needs to be paid in one go before the commencement of the session.",

The college hostel does provide proper housing facilities and food. However, it cannot directly compare to the best food we would find around the area.",

The semester exams are moderately difficult but manageable. Class notes are very important and sufficient for good CGPA. The pass percentage is around 85 percent. Internal assessment, assignments, and lab work also contribute to final grades. However, like most universities, self-learning and internships play a crucial role in getting top-tier placements. However, the exposure is somewhat limited, so students need to put in extra effort by seeking off-campus internships, competitive coding, and networking opportunities to stay ahead.",
              "Other": "Fests and departmental programs happen regularly. There are various clubs, though extracurricular activities are still developing. Managing them with studies can be tough since the university focuses more on lectures and academics."

Technically, students have access to attend the fest on the main campus by traveling there from their 2nd campus.

However, when there are placement opportunities, which are not available very often, students get placed in companies like Bajaj, BSNL, Jio, MI.Com, etc.",
              "Infrastructure": "Our college has a beautiful infrastructure and every possible facility from sports to labs. Our college has high-speed internet, and the labs are equipped with the latest machines, computers, etc. Classrooms have modern equipment like smart boards and speakers. It also has good food.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers here are talented, helpful and well educated. They use a good technique of teaching. Semester exams are easy if you study, and the teachers are always available when you need them. The pass percentage in exams is 40% of marks. My course is relevant to the curriculum and also makes students industry-ready.",
              "Other": "I chose ECE because I love the technical field, and it fascinates me. Our college has a good environment, education, infrastructure and facilities but lacks in placements."

              "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure and facilities available are of average quality. Wi-Fi, labs, classrooms, library, etc., are of average quality. Many times we went to the lab, but the equipment was not available or is not working. Hostel quality is good, but the food provided in the mess is not that good. Medical facilities and sports were good.",

The course curriculum is good and somewhat makes students industry-ready. Semester exams difficulty is average, and most of the students get passed. The pass percentage is approximately 80-85%."

              "Placements": "Our batch of B.Tech electrical engineering was the first batch in the university. Though the course was new, the university managed to provide us better education, and almost all the equipment was available for experimental purposes. We were sent to NIT Srinagar for those particals, which were not available in our institution. As far as the placements are concerned, it was almost 0%, that is why I rate it a single star.",
              "Infrastructure": "The facilities and infrastructure are good and emerging at a fast rate. Though the university is new, the rate of development and infrastructure is high. The whole university is covered with high-speed Wi-Fi internet. A separate browsing center was set up for the students. The facilities available in the hostel were great. The hostel for girls is inside the university premises, and the boys' hostel is about 500m away from the university. Medical facilities and an ambulance are available 24x7. There is a decent canteen inside the university premises which provides food and other items at great discount.",
              "Faculty": "The university has good faculty members. They taught us in a better way and were greatly helpful. The quality of teaching was excellent, especially Dr. Shahkar Nehvi. He was a great caring teacher for us. Other faculty members were also good and helpful at any time.",
              "Other": "I was a Diploma engineering student and was eager to do B.Tech, but due to family issues, I was not able to move outside the state for further studies. Here, the other universities were not giving admissions for lateral entries, but this university provided me an opportunity to achieve my goal. I would like to say one thing that our university needs to improve in terms of placements. Though the placement cell is set up there, it is not active. Scholarships are available for those students who took admissions from the beginning of the course, and this opportunity was not given to lateral entry students. I felt greatly painful when I applied for the scholarship and got rejected. Overall, the university was a great place to learn new things and gain knowledge."

The benches are satisfied. The bathroom has broken seats. It does not provide good drinking water.",

It would be better if students were trained from the second year onwards to become industry-ready and improve communication skills.

Many students went to higher studies, while some settled for really low packages like 3 LPA. Infosys HackWithInfy hired 5 students with 9.5 LPA and 1 student with 6.25 LPA. The highest package on campus was 42.70 LPA at ServiceNow. Many students in the 3rd year do internships in various domains like app development, web development, graphic design, editing, and cryptography. The top role offered by recruiters was in app development.",
              "Infrastructure": "This college is known for its amazing infrastructure. We have Wi-Fi accessibility everywhere, and charging ports are available on each desk in each class. The library is good, where you can get the books issued, and the management keeps introducing new books. The hostel has everything good except the mess. So, not talking about the food, medical facilities are always available, and you can play sports and games. College has a volleyball, basketball and badminton court. Girls are not allowed to leave the hostel after 8.",
              "Faculty": "Many of the teachers are neither helpful, nor qualified, nor knowledgeable. You will have to learn everything on your own. Ours is an AKTU batch, so the exams were really tough. But now KIET has become a deemed university, so for incoming students, it has introduced courses that are really relevant according to the industry, and the exams are not too tough.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because, amongst other private colleges of AKTU, KIET is the best. Management is not strict. We have events going on almost every month. The major technical one was Innotech, then we had DataVerse. Various clubs in the college keep organising different contests and hackathons, which is something I really love. I have maintained my Leetcode score because of it."

The placements are decent but have declined this year, with most packages ranging from 3–5 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "Although a new MAC lab has been built this year, other labs are still not good and feel outdated. The infrastructure of the college is quite good but needs some improvements. Labs are mostly outdated, especially the mechanical labs, but some new labs are good, like the CNC lab and 3D printing lab. There are two libraries in the college, one of which has a vast collection of books and resources. Most canteens are good but need some improvement in seating and crowd management.",
              "Faculty": "Teaching is quite good, with practical knowledge as well. However, I do not like the programming faculty because of their lack of knowledge and school-like behavior. Apart from this, exams go smoothly. The syllabus is good, but I do not think it makes students fully industry-ready. They have to improve their skills on their own.",
              "Other": "I chose KIET because it is suggested by my school teachers and it is near my house, which is the biggest reason for joining this college. I wish to add more practical-based learning, which could increase opportunities. The campus is overcrowded, as there are many students in different branches of engineering."

Many of my friends complain about losing hair and having pimples. Mess food is average and canteen food is good but you cannot eat it every day. A doctor is always available. We have a cricket club volleyball club athletics club martial arts shooting NCC and that is quite a lot.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are not at all knowledgeable. It seems that they are themselves confused in their subjects. There is no point in asking questions to them as they will somehow misunderstand the question and just repeat everything they said. Curriculum is quite relevant. In the first year we have C and Web designing and in the second year Java so it is good. Semester exams are easy you can easily pass. Just do not get detained because of low attendance 75 percent.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I have interest in coding and technical stuff. The best things in this course are that everything you study is relevant. I even feel that I can apply Chemistry to solve a real problem. Kiet is autonomous college it has the power to make its own syllabus so we do not have to follow the prescribed AKTU syllabus which is good. Tech events are really good. We have Innotech recently wherein many students showcase their projects. Crowd is quite nice and helpful. Scholarships are easily provided."

Only 14 companies visited our campus, and only 5 of them are software-based. 3 are core electronics, others are coaching institutes and non-teaching like sales executive. The highest package is 7 LPA, but of the pool campus, 3.6 LPA is the lowest. Amarakosha, Vegam, Minfy are a few companies.",
              "Infrastructure": "Labs are good and have good instructors and equipment. But one thing is that equipment are not enough and get outnumbered by the number of students. Faculty members are knowledgeable but do not have an interest in teaching us; most of them are like that. Only a few of the faculty members are supportive and help us to skill up.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers are very helpful and the teaching quality is very nice and they are well qualified and knowledgeable. Our college is under VTU order. It only listens to VTU rules and regulations and follows according to that university. Personally, I think passing is not difficult but depends on how you study for it. There is not much break in this college; you always have to work and study."

              "Placements": "Placements at KLE Teach are decent but not the best. I have seen and heard from seniors that roughly 40-50% students manage to get placed. The biggest recruiters are Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Bosch, and Deloitte. The average package offered is around 4 LPA. Most of the offers are for roles in IT services, software development, testing, and consulting. Core branch students also get a few opportunities. Around 30-40% manage to get placed through the college of tie-ups.",
              "Infrastructure": "Our college has a really good infrastructure. Classrooms are clean, spacious, and well-equipped with projectors and Wi-Fi. Labs are well-maintained with the required equipment. The library is big with plenty of books and digital resources. Hostel rooms are decent with proper facilities, and Wi-Fi works fine. Mess food is okay, but not like home, but it's still manageable. While the canteen has better options. Sports facilities like basketball, cricket, and indoor games are available. Overall, campus infrastructure is supported for both academics and student life.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members are mixed. Some professors are really helpful and knowledgeable, while others are average in teaching quality. The curriculum is decent but not fully industry-oriented, so extra skills outside of classes are needed to stay ahead. Exams are manageable if you study regularly, though a few can be tricky. Overall, the pass percentage is fairly high, but scoring marks require some effort. In short, academics are okay, there is much scope for improvement in teaching methods, and making the syllabus more industry-ready.",
              "Other": "I chose this college mainly for its reputation and the variety of opportunities it offered. The best part of the campus life there is the fests, clubs, and plenty of extracurricular activities that keep things lively. The crowd is diverse, and it's easy to connect with people from different backgrounds. Campus is well-connected and has a good atmosphere on the improvement side. I feel that the curriculum could be more industry-oriented, and the placements of core branches need to be more. Overall, the experience has been positive and engaging."

I am currently in the second year, and I will be completing the course by 2028. The placements, as informed by the seniors and staff, were awesome. Almost 80% of students get placed in companies with an average package of ₹4 to 5 LPA, and almost 160 students joined Information Technology in the year 2024. The top recruiting companies for my college as of 2024 are Amazon, Wipro, Accenture, TCS, SAP, Cognizant, etc. Software Developer, Full Stack Developer, Cybersecurity Analyst, Data Analyst, and Cloud Engineer.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure of the college is the best, with all the requirements and facilities starting from the laboratories for all the departments like Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Data Structure, Embedded Systems, Cloud Computing, Mechanical Labs, and many more. The college also has enough auditoriums and halls, and even two theatres for mass crowd functions and other events. The hostel facilities are good, with enough water and daily cleaning, with three meals and one snack per day. The college has 3 canteen facilities and separate places to sit and eat. It also has a gym and a clinic. The food is vegetarian.",
              "Faculty": "All the staff members of the particular department strive to give the students their knowledge and experience. The lab facilities are well used by the staff members, and there are two to three mentors for every department. They will assist you with any queries, and there is a student council called OSA that takes care of the students' mental health and well-being. The semester exams are comparatively easy if the student focuses on the classes. No need to panic. The questions would obviously be easy and well-known to attend.",

But if you have arrears and did not opt for the campus placements, you will not get a chance to be placed in the campus interview. Top companies that recruit our students are Solitone Technologies, Delta Electronics, and more. As my college is located in Coimbatore, many companies from Coimbatore may come for the placements. There are many possibilities to get an internship. Our college faculty members provide more opportunities by giving information about the available internship offers, but it is your responsibility to grab them.",
              "Infrastructure": "Our college provides a vast green environment. There are Wi-fi facilities everywhere. Every classroom has projectors for PPT presentations. Our labs are good, but I would not say the best, i.e., mechatronics engineering. There is a central library with Wi-fi facility and library computers that students can use. There is a medical clinic present on the college campus and a free ambulance facility for transportation. My hostel life is good with well-maintained hostel buildings, Wi-fi facilities, room cleaning, laundry facilities, and gym are available. Mess food is good compared to other colleges, but it is pure vegetarian. Sports are encouraged in our college.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are well-qualified and supportive if approached. There is a feedback system in our college. For every subject, every semester, there is feedback taken at the end. Students can share their thoughts on a specific faculty or a specific subject. Our semester exams are based on the course outcome, which ensures quality education. The pass percentage is 50%.

There was some, but not much, medical and athletic support.",

The hospital was available but the staff behavior was rude.",

The hostel's mess food quality is very good and is cooked in a clean environment. The college staff is well-trained, and hostel discipline is very well maintained. The hostel has a common room with an LCD TV. The hostel also provides 24-hour water and power supply.",

The syllabus includes the topics that are important for competitive exams such as CSIR NET JRF, GATE, etc. Along with theoretical knowledge, emphasis is also given to real-world practical application through projects, dissertations, internships, etc. The exams are conducted frequently, which helps to keep our brains active. The exams are not very difficult, but they are good enough to make us think practically and critically."

Students are forced to live in 5-bedded sharing rooms, where 5 tables,  5 chairs,  5 almirahs, and 5 beds are provided for each student, but it becomes very tough to follow the individual routine. Mess food quality is poor, and the only reason institute states is that Ravangala is a very remote location.",
              "Faculty": "For me, it seems okay. But the question that comes in exams is mostly moderate to difficult. Teaching methods sometimes need to change because they need to understand that all students are not same and to bring them on one page, they need to change their teaching style. The whole semester contains only exam, exam, and exam."

But excluding this hostel facility, the rest of the facilities are okay, type. Classrooms are well equipped with smart boards, and labs are also well equipped.",
              "Faculty": "Will say it's really hectic. The curriculum for BTECH is to do all the things including theory, practical, viva, mid-term, and end-term exams and projects in the final year as well. Almost 5-6 hours of daily classes and 2 mid-term exams will be there with one end-term. But this is more or less the same in all other IITs and NITs as well. So you can't complain about it.",

Despite the temporary campus, it boasts a great location surrounded by mountains and lush greenery. Everything is available on campus except for the hostel for first-year students. Yes, first-year students have to stay outside the campus in Ravangla city. The college provides both bus services and hostels for first-year students.

If you face challenges in any topic, faculty members also allow you to ask for personal assistance within the department.",

Scholarships are also good if your parents income is less than 5 lpa; your 2/3rd tuition fee is waived, and if your parents income is less than 1 lpa, you have to pay no tuition fee.

For the CSE branch, as of I know, the pass percentage is 40% including assignments.",

Many companies were regular recruiters, like ICICI, HDFC, CITI, Wipro, AYE Finance, TASL, etc. In total, around 70+ companies visited our college, offering more than 100 positions. The highest package offered to us was 18+ LPA, and the average package of the college was 9.5 LPA.",

Another major issue was the food, the mess food had been really pathetic even after repeated complaints. If something tasty was ever cooked, it was rare. The fee of the hostel was Rs. 62,000 yearly.",
              "Faculty": "Almost all faculty members were Ph.D. holders or PG qualified, and all had more than 10 years of experience, which is why the success story was high. They were very interactive with students, and the standard of teaching was above excellence. Every month, we had internals, and every 4 months, we had externals. It was a nice exam structure. We could gain more knowledge through practicals. If we failed in any exam, makeup exams were conducted very soon, and results were also announced quickly. Very good courses were offered by the college, and exams were conducted very strictly by the department, which helped students develop themselves through college activities and increased their willpower to prove their talent."

Course curriculum is extremely learning and application-based with no use of textbooks and real-world examples of applying concepts. Focused towards company requirements and how a course will help us in the same. Semester-end exams are pretty simple as an entire semester is divided into 5 modules to be completed in 3 months. All 5 modules are easy to understand. The pass percentage is 35% excluding internals.",
              "Other": "CSE is what I have been passionate about doing for the longest time but for the same price, this college offered me a specialization course on data science along with CSE which is maximum value for money. The best thing about my course is that my minor degree helps me scale tasks that normal CSE wouldn't be able to. Sargam is the biggest college festival in Bangalore and it is organized by NHCE and it is amazing. Crowd is very like-minded. There are hospitals, multiple food chains, and malls near the college. Scholarship exams are conducted every year which depends on marks up to 70%. There are 20 clubs to take part in."

The highest was 42 LPA, and the lowest was 2.5 to 3 LPA. The top companies that came for recruiting were Accenture, Allegion, Bosch, Capgemini, LTI Mindtree, Cognizant, Samsung and many more. 40% of the students got internship opportunities. The top roles offered were GET, analyst, software engineer, tester and many more.",
              "Infrastructure": "The facilities and infrastructure at NMAMIT are of good standard. A green campus with lots of biodiversity. Speaking about the ELC department, the labs and the classrooms are well-equipped with the latest technologies. The boys hostel is nearby the playground and various sports complexes, with some amount of time and coaching for extracurricular activities. The girls hostel is in and around the main college campus.",
              "Faculty": "The lecturers at NMAMIT are well qualified, with most of them having doctorate degrees in their respective fields. The course curriculum is very relevant and provides good theoretical and practical knowledge. The semester exams are easy to moderate, with questions asked based on what was taught in the curriculum. The pass percentage is about 90% in a batch of 200 students.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because of the good faculty in the ELC department. The placements were pretty decent but core companies are hard to get into due to the limited number."

              "Placements": "It is a normal engineering college, not like IIT so student placements are not good, but many students get placed. Around 10% of students are placed because of covid-19 in the previous year. The minimum salary package offered is 4 LPA. I heard from a senior that ONGC came in a particular year. In the previous year, students did not go for any internships, but this year students are going for internships in a company name JCV Company Limited.",
              "Infrastructure": "Everything is available like Wi-Fi, laboratories, classrooms, and a library. But infrastructure is not good but now it is improving. In the hostel everything is good. Rooms are very good but some are very dirty so it depends on students to get a good room. Mess is good but someday food is not good. The medical facilities are very good.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are very talented. They are teaching to their best level. Teachers are well qualified. This semester students are getting ready for the industry. Semester exams are moderate, it is heard if students do not study well. The pass percentage is around 30%."

              "Placements": "Placements are not so good in our college as it resides in remote area of Arunachal Pradesh in the North East region. Some of the public sector companies visit the campus for placements which include Tata, Asahi Glass, ONGC, OIL, NHPC, etc. Apart from that, other private companies like Tech Mahindra also visit the campus for placements at irregular intervals. But, this year it has been good in terms of placement as recently Google visited the campus for a placement with around 17 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "Hostel is average as the existing infrastructure of the building dates back in the era of 2000s. As the institute was established in 1980s, the buildings of the hostel block have turned much old and there is a urgent need of renovation. Apart from that, hostel has good facilities in terms of living experience, which includes good food quality. The hostels have good Wi-Fi connection, which is an advantage for the students. The hostel complex has good number of shops. Also, we have basketball courts, badminton courts, tennis courts and all other sports facilities.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are well qualified in NERIST, most of them come from other states of the country as well. Teachers are well-trained in IITs and NITs of the country. But, one of the major problems of the institutes teaching curriculum is that Ph.D. students are given the job to teach the students, which makes it bad for the students. Because Ph.D. students are not keen to teach the students for free. This is the only problem that the institute has for a long time. Apart from that all courses are good and have good pass percentages among the students. Semester results are also adequately maintained by the hard working students with the aid of online study materials.",
              "Other": "NERIST has a rich and vibrant culture where students from all the states of Northeast come to study together. The institute holds beautiful cultural festivals that enlighten the experience of studying in the campus."

Indian Army and some PSUs also visit the campus, but you need to be from the northeast region to be selected in those companies.",

First-year students get their own hostel, and it is very good for them. You will love the serene view of the mountains. There is Wi-Fi for 24 hours and highly equipped labs. Good food is available 3 times a day.",

However, the same students will get jobs on their own performance. All the high-profile jobs grabbed by alumni have been through off-campus placements. But our college shows wrong data that it has offered those jobs to just maintain its rank.",

The internet is very fast, but there are useless restrictions on everything. There is a censored life. The hostel authorities are apt in torturing students. The cleanliness is very bad, and unhygienic food is served. If you say something about it, they will make a wrong case of indiscipline and disturb you with legal consequences.",
              "Faculty": "Except for some faculty members, none of the others is good. Some faculty members even don't know the fundamentals and are quite arrogant. However, lab staff members are good. The semester exams are good. Some faculty members have maintained the standard well. Only for them, the department is still thriving.",
              "Other": "The college used to be good, but good students have left the college. There are many politics at the administrative level. The administration is corrupted, so the functioning of the college is difficult."

However, I have heard from some seniors that placements for the civil branch are pretty average. The average package is 3-4 LPA. A minimum CGPA of 6.5 and no backlogs for sitting in placements.",
              "Infrastructure": "In the university, the civil branch has a combined department with architecture, where they provide three classrooms for civil students and some labs. The university also has a one central library and a gym. In the hostel, the university provides all basic necessities, but the only reason they lack is cleanliness, as hostels are not up to that level. The food provided is not good. But the overall experience is good.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members of the civil branch are very good, and all teachers are well-qualified, but sometimes they fail to connect with students. The civil engineering course provides us with all theoretical knowledge and also teaches us about the industry and the future of civil engineering. There are two exams in one semester a minor exam which is of 20 marks and one major exam of 40 marks. The rest 40 marks depend on the professor, whether he can take quiz or assignment.",
              "Other": "The only reason I chose this course is because of my family background, and I also know some professors. The only thing I would like them to improve is that they should give more practical knowledge and also put less pressure on students. The college has many fests and functions, including Ekatva, Musical Fest, Dance Club, and Zenith Club. The university also has extracurricular activities and tournaments for sports like Sarang."

We have a very large ground on our campus where you can play any sport.",

The minimum percentage required to pass is 36%.",

Roads inside the college you can go from anywhere and can end up in the place you want on the map. The building is very good. There is a lot of crowd in college that is all students. The nightlife of the college is also very good. The view is very good. The season and the weather are just amazing."

Other than that Infosys offered 3.5 LPA, Accenture offered 4 LPA, Range offered 5 LPA, and Cognizant offered 3.5 LPA, 5.5 LPA, and 6.7 LPA (results haven't been disclosed yet). The highest package was offered by Forbess Marshal, which is 7.8 LPA but it selected only 1 student from CSE. The placement has been worsening year by year here and it's not worth it. The location of this for placement is also not good.",

There's Wi-Fi available here but you cannot rely on it, there are frequent shutdowns, apart from that websites like Quora are banned on the university Wi-Fi. Classrooms are fine but you can expect the projectors to not work. Initially, the classes for CSE were held in a lecture theatre which has the facility AC and projectors working there but later on, they were shifted to classrooms. Library is fine, equipped with AC and you can find books related to your course. Labs are pretty outdated.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are fine and lenient. You cannot expect all of them to be good but they are just fine. The course content however I'll say is pretty outdated, it definitely won't make you industry-ready. You can get a good grade by studying 1 night before the exam, to pass you need to have at least 33 marks in the subject out of 100, which is pretty easy. Exams are checked by subject teachers.",
              "Other": "I would not recommend you to join this college unless you are a local. The crowd is not good, the university spends the least it can for extracurricular activities. Campus surroundings are just like semi-developed villages, there are a lot of unnecessary restrictions, especially on girls. Fest are conducted once a semester if you are lucky. For connectivity you can use auto, metadors are also there but they are overcrowded and their frequency is low."

The marking scheme seems biased, as some local students from Jammu benefit from higher lab marks and internal marks. Jammu students are favored, while students from outside are not treated as well in all aspects. Teachers are also biased here.

Some practical knowledge is implemented, but the college has no active clubs that work in favor of students, and no fests are happening. This can be improved to give students more practical and hands-on experience. Scholarships are available based on JEE Main rank and other meritorious exams. However, the crowd here favors Jammu students, which sometimes creates disturbance and ruins the hostel facilities. All the administration also favors them."

Many colleges fail to teach a wide range of technical resources and lab facilities, which are easily available for students to explore their field of expertise.",
              "Infrastructure": "The course infrastructure is far greater and perfect for my curriculum, but the hostel is not what I would oblige to. The food provided here is fabulous, but not the accommodation, but since I am in Incubation, I don't have to worry about that. This is an advantage that Incubation students have over hostellers.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers are knowledgeable enough to take classes, but some are far more knowledgeable in their field of expertise and would help students to push further than the academics, which is far more important, and the teachers would also learn with us daily, along with their careers.",

The best part of the course is its combination of electronics and real-time industrial processes.

The food quality in the canteen and hostel is a matter of concern. Wi-Fi connectivity is limited, with very low speeds, around 50 kbps.

In the hostel, I have a 2-seater room with 2 beds, 2 tables, and 2 chairs. The room has proper ventilation.

I think there should be more focus on providing practical knowledge in this course, as the complexity of the theory makes it difficult to understand. You will find lots of recreational programs on campus; various events like Inscignis, Techxetra, and food festivals are generally organized here. The campus is very beautiful, as it is covered with lush greenery and good infrastructure. However, connectivity is not very good here.

And there was a time when the portions were not completed but still, the staff just went on with it, didn't listen to students and made us write the exam. So these kinds of things should be avoided for the best of the students because we know what we go through if we don't get proper marks. Other things, like events, festivals, and crowds, are fantastic. You will make great memories and 1 tip is to enjoy as much as possible in the first few seems because the last seems to be hectic. Although do keep in mind that you have to keep your CGPA high from the start itself because you never know when and how it will drop if it does."

Though a few topics are outdated, real industry skills still depend heavily on self-learning and projects. Semester exams are concept-based and generally of medium difficulty. If concepts are understood and notes are prepared, passing is manageable, but last-minute rote learning is risky. The pass percentage roughly ranges between 55% and 85%, depending on the batch and subject, so results are decent, but not everyone passes easily."

They are extremely helpful, give proper guidance to the project works & motivate us to attend some industrial internships. In my opinion, our course name should be renamed as mathematics & computing, so that we can also attend some campus interviews with IT companies. Discussing the exam, sometimes question papers are from some IITs, so the level of the exam is always high to moderate. The faculty members are too lenient, so we can achieve a good mark here.",

The pass percentage is above 85%.",

However it is the oldest technical institute in Odisha, so it has a huge alumni network and also a good reputation. Also, this college provides a B.Tech degree under 4 Lacs in 4 years, which is quite cheap. However, the teaching methodologies, infrastructure, hostel food, etc., should be improved. There are two annual fests, Samavesh and Vasant. But the connectivity here is very poor, especially the railway.

The faculty will send students to the placement drives, for example, if an IT company visits the college for placement, then the faculty will send students.

One is YASH, a cultural event, and the other is TECHFEST, which is a technical event."
